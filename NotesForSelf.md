First we started with making all the component files
then import them on index.js
organize them into folders
Home.js, created the createdeck button that routes to the createdeck page

made the deckinfo component, that will show all the information already in the system.

view button goes to deckdetails screen

we have a FlashCards component, will be rendered on deckdetails
like how we used the home page to show the decks on the page,

// <div>
// <h3>Study: {cards.name}</h3>
// <div>of {cards.cards.length}</div>
// </div>
